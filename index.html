    <p style="color: blueviolet;">
      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are
      to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of
      work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
      External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

    <h1 class="para">Why should we use CSS</h1>
    <p class="para">
      CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages,
      including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the
      presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small
      screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any
      XML-based markup language.
